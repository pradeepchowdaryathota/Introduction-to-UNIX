Description :
The repository is designed to create a shell script which can perform the tasks independantly. The end goal should be that a user could download your script from your repository and be able to successfully run it on any bash compatible computer. Accomplishing this, may require some set up work outside of the terminal, but the end product should be entirely independent.
